# Discrete Log Problem Solver

This folder contains two approaches to solving a DLP:

The naive approach, implemented in dlp_naive.py, uses trial multiplication to eventually hit the correct exponent.

A better approach, implemented in dlp_bsgs, utilizes the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm, a classic example of a "meet-in-the-middle" approach.
