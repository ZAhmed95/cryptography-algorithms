# Pollard Rho Integer Factorization

The pollard_rho.py file contains a basic implementation of the Pollard Rho integer factorization algorithm.

The Pollard Rho algorithm uses cycles in modular fields to detect factors of an integer. The algorithm is explained in more detail in the docstring of the pollard_rho function, and here: [Pollard's Rho algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm)

Run test.py to see it work.
